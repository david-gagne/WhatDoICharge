**WhatToCharge**.TK ☚ (Emphasis on the _tk_ domain extension. I don't own the .com, so I can't tell you what you'll find there.)

A calculator to help you find out what price you'd need to charge _before_ online payment processing fees in order to earn the money you want for your product or service.


**Example**

Meet Felipe Vargas, a freelance writer from New York City.

Felipe is setting up his business to accept payments online for the first time, and a friend suggested that Felipe use Stripe to process his client payments. And after a quick search, Felipe finds that Stripe will deduct 2.9% + 30¢ from every card payment made by his clients.

So Felipe wants to know...

_"How much do I need to charge in order to make my fee of $1000?_


**Questions like Felipe's are why I created WhatToCharge**.TK ☚ (Again, emphasis on the .TK bit), a simple calculator to help you figure out what to charge before payment processing fees.

Felipe would have to charge $1,030.18 in order to make $1000 using Stripe, by the way.
